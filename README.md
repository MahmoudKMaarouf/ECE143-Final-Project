# ECE 143 Final Project: The Difficulties in Learning Python 
### by Mahmoud Maarouf, Vidya Kanekal, Hamed Mojtahed, Kevin Anderson, and Songlin Chen
We analyzed the "Python Questions from Stack Overflow" Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/pythonquestions?select=Questions.csv) to see what the common difficulties were in learning Python. 
The library dependencies are listed in the environment.yml file.


## Data Preprocessing


## LDA Topic Modeling


## Sentiment Analysis


## Extra Analysis
The `extra_anlysis.py` file contains the code to analyze the dataset and create visual represensations of the trends. This analysis includes the most frequent libraries, operating system, IDE, and package manager. It requires the `Questons.csv`, `Answers.csv`, and `Tags.csv` files in the same directory as the code in order to read the data. The third party modules needed include:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
